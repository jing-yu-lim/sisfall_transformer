# Fall-Detection-System
Hi Everybody. This is Mohammadali(mojtaba) Sefidi Esfahani. <br>
In this project I have worked on SisFall Dataset and the main purpose of this project is to design a neural network model to predict the fall with high accuracy. The main idea which makes my model so efficent is working on addresses instead of the whole dataset as much as possible. This idea makes the model much faster.As number of Fall records are much less than non fall records, The other Idea which enhaces the models accuracy is balancing the dataset. <br>
Also you can see models' performance summary in the picture below.<br>

You can see more detail in the code. thanks for your attentions.
