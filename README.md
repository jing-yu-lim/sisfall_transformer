# Fall-Detection-System
Hi Everybody. This is Mohammadali (mojtaba) Sefidi Esfahani and Mohammad Fattahian. <br>
In this project, I have worked on the SisFall Dataset, and the main purpose of this project is to design a neural network model to predict the fall with high accuracy. The main idea which makes my model so efficient is working on addresses instead of the whole dataset as much as possible. This idea makes the model much faster. As the number of Fall records are much less than non-fall records, The other Idea which enhances the model's accuracy is balancing the dataset. Another Idea that improves the performances is making predictions based on the ensemble models' concept.<br>
You can see the models' performance summary in the picture below.<br>

Also, You can see more detail in the code. Thanks for your attention.
