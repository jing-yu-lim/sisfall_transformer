# Fall-Detection-System
Hi Everybody. This is Mohammadali(mojtaba) Sefidi Esfahani. <br>
In this project I have worked on SisFall Dataset and the main purpose of this project is to design a neural network model to predict the fall with accuracy. The main idea which makes my model so efficent is working on addresses instead of the whole dataset as much as possible. This idea makes the model much faster.As number of Fall records are much less than non fall records, The other Idea which enhaces the model is balancing the dataset. <br>
You can see more detail in the code. thanks.
